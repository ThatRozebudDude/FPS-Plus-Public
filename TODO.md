# Port 0.7.X Features

- Extended stages.
- Freeplay difficulty indicators. (Maybe) (Also thank u fabs)
- Replace offset calibration song with new official one. (Maybe, mine is kinda old, might do a custom mix or something.)
- If I missed anything add it here I guess.

# Possible Future Version Features

- Localiztion files.

# Known Bugs

- Chart editor transition to Lil' Buddies is broken.
	- Maybe remove it? IDK if people care about it + it could annoy someone who is charting...
