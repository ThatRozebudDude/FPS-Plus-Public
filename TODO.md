# 6.3.0 *(Planned Features)*

- Config menu redesign.
	- Maybe change how config settings are accessed? A lil' clunky right now.
- Mod configs. *(Options that can be set in the mod menu and can be read by mods.)*

# Known Bugs

- Chart editor transition to Lil' Buddies is broken.
	- Maybe remove it? IDK if people care about it + it could annoy someone who is charting...
