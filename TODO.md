- POSSIBLY see if it's possible to get old frameWidth and frameHeight stuff (not a huge priority but housemod will thank me)

# Possible Future Version Features

- Localiztion files.
- Minecraft like tags for song remix selection.

# Known Bugs

- Chart editor transition to Lil' Buddies is broken.
	- Maybe remove it? IDK if people care about it + it could annoy someone who is charting...
