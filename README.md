# Friday Night Funkin' FPS Plus
Friday Night Funkin' FPS Plus is an engine mod of Friday Night Funkin' that aims to improve gameplay and add quality of life features.

*You can find the original game here:* **[Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) - [itch.io](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) - [GitHub](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin)**

## 

FPS Plus was designed to increase the framerate of Friday Night Funkin' and is still currently (as far as I know) the only engine that allows for an unlocked framerate. It also features a plethora of enhancements and quality of life features. A bunch of systems are also changed as well that alter the workflow of coding stuff into the engine.

## Building

To download and install all libraries required compiling, you must install Haxe's Module Manager (`hmm`).

* To install and set up `hmm`, run the following commands:
    ```
        haxelib --global install hmm
        haxelib --global run hmm setup
    ```

* After `hmm`'s install is complete, run `hmm install` in the root directory to install all haxelibs.

* After installing all libraries, run `haxelib run lime setup` to set up `lime`.

To set up build tools, refer to part 8 of [this document](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/blob/main/docs/COMPILING.md).

Run `lime test PLATFORM` or `lime build PLATFORM` to compile the game.

**If you are getting an error that says that a bunch of Flixel classes are missing fields, you need to reinstall Haxe. I don't know what causes this I just know that reinstalling Haxe should fix it.**
